The first animation is using the Parallax and inFlatTorus concepts, it looks like you navigate in a 3d world of colored circles. In the second one, there are circles bouncing on the edges of the screen. The third one is a mini-game, where you control a shooter and you have to destroy circles comming towards the bottom of the screen.",
